 # update is required to update the repositories to see the new packages for
 # Docker.
 - sudo apt-get update

 # Now we can install the newer docker-engine which is required for the newer
 # docker-composer we will install next. The messy options are to force it to
 # be non-interactive (normally it asks you a bunch of config questions).
 #- sudo apt-get install -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" --force-yes -y docker-engine
 - sudo apt-get install --force-yes -y docker-ce

 # Print out the current docker-compose version. Once this reports 1.6+ then we
 # do not need the following steps.
 - docker-compose --version

 # Setup your application stack. You may need to tweak these commands if you
 # doing out-of-the-ordinary docker-compose builds.
 #- docker-compose pull
 - docker-compose build
 - docker-compose start

 # You will want this for logging. If one of your containers does not build for
 # whatever reason it's best to report that now before your tests start
 # otherwise it can be really tricky to debug why tests are failing sometimes.
 - docker ps

 - cd app && rspec spec
